        <h1>THE BRAKE LIGHT OF THE FUTURE</h1>
        <h2>Brake Buddy exists to prevent rear-ended accidents and make the roads safer for all.</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Brake Buddy is a
            manufacturer and
            distributor of brake light
            kits for automobiles. Our products
            are differentiated
            because our kits use specialized
            technology to allow trailing cars
            in traffic to gauge the force on
            the brake from the car in front of
            them. </p>
        <br>
        <p>We are a company
            that supplies our products to car
            manufacturers all over the US and
            also sells individual units in
            stores like Home Depot and
            ACE Hardware. The culture
            of Brake Buddy is
            prioritizing the safety
            of the customers
            over profit. Our
            company culture
            is also technological
            and innovative with
            our slogan being “The
            brake light of the
            future.”</p>
